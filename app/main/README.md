# Liveness Tests Main Service
## What does this do?
This exposes the authentication service to the necessary endpoints.
It acts as a consolodation layer for our other services.
It also serves the required web portal, to ensure our authentication system works properly.

## Technologies
The server side uses ASP DOT NET CORE 2.1 to power it. 

The client side uses Typescript, and is served by Kestrel (part of asp dotnetcore).
