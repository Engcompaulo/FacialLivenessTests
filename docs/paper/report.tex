\section{Introduction}
    % What is the project about?
    Currently, username and password authentication is commonplace throughout the web. However, username and password
    based authentication systems have a number of problems. Some common passwords can be broken using dictionary attacks,
    especially if they consist partially or entirely of a word in a standard dictionary. Furthermore, the process of shoulder surfing is possible (watching out
    for someone's password, and how they type it).

    An easy to use system is necessary to remove the choice from the user (in terms of password), relying on the user being automatically
    detected, and several confirmation methods to ensure the user is indeed who they say they are (and not just someone spoofing the system).
    Before such a system is developed, a facial liveness testing method must be found that operated in near real-time, and that is fairly accurate.

\section{Solution}
    % Solution to the problem

    \subsection{A system for preventing 3D spoofing attacks}
        While the systems before might go partially towards preventing 3D spoofing attacks, we now propose a method
        that is designed for classifying facial liveness based on a 3D point cloud.

        \subsubsection{Point Cloud Reconstruction}
            In order to classify an image/video, a 3D point cloud needs to be created, containing many 3D points $(x,y,z)$
            of a user's face. With video, producing this 3D point cloud is fairly easy, using Structure from Motion.

            However, some information may not necessarily be known, such as camera information, so this could prove more tricky.
            

            TODO: confirm what method we'll use (leaning towards 3D reconstruction)

        \subsubsection{3D point cloud classification}
            An architecture called PointNet can then be used, being passed the 3D point information. This can then be used to classify.
\section{Results}

\section{Evaluation}
    % How well our system works, how well did it assess stuff, and how it can be improved.
    % what are the uses of our research? e.g. influence and improve the design of xyz...
    TODO evaluation


    % Improvements:
    % 3D attacks more difficult. One could extend this method using 3D reconstruction (sfm based on videos)
    % then recovering 3D details, and using these as input features.
    % this would allow for 3D reconstruction to some extent. Would require video input.
\section{Conclusions}
    % overall, what did hte projct show?
