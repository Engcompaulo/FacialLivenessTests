% - Cameras used: mobile cameras (most methods use average resolution images from webcams or camera phone)
% - "Deep learning based face liveness detection in videos" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090202/
% - Ideas: texture based - an image of a face will have the facial textures, while the texture of a piece of paper is very different.
% - Video vs Photo. Wtih a video, you don't just use the subject image, but also factor in movement and changes.
    
    \paragraph{Title}
        Facial Liveness Testing for the Web - what are the most suitable and effective methods?
    \paragraph{Project Type}
        Computer Vision, Image Processing and Security
    \paragraph{Description}
    In order to avoid spoofing in facial recognition systems, liveness tests are needed. While various liveness tests exist,
    some require specialized hardware and are therefore not suitable. This project aims to select the most suitable methods for
    a web facial authentication system, and analyze their effectiveness in terms of security. A liveness test is suitable if it
    uses only one built-in camera (found within laptops in the webcam, or in mobile devices as the front camera), and potentially
    the device screen (which varies in size depending on the device used), and can be done in near real time. The purpose of this
    project is to find the most suitable and effective facial liveness methods which can be used in a web-based application (by following
    the constraints defined above).
    \paragraph{Minimum Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Build the test framework, to test using several different datasets and liveness tests.
            \item Implement the image quality based liveness test.
            \item Train the classifier used within the image quality based liveness test.
            \item Evaluate the image quality liveness test.
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Intermediate Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implement the eye tracking liveness test.
            \item Train the eye tracking liveness test classifier.
            \item Evaluate the eye tracking liveness test.
            \item Implement the CNN based liveness method (involving texture and temporal metrics).
            \item Train the CNN based liveness method classifier.
            \item Evaluate the CNN based liveness method.
            \item Compare CNN, eye tracking, and image quality based liveness methods together.
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Advanced Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implement a consolidation layer, combining the metrics above through a classifier.
            \item Train the consolidation layer classifier
            \item Evaluate the performance of the consolidation layer (i.e. all methods when integrated together) compared to each individual method on it's own.
            \item Implement the facial flashing liveness test \footnote{An optional objective. Not shown in the Gantt chart as it's not an essential component of our research.}
        \end{itemize}
