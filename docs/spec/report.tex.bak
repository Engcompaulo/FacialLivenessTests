% - What are liveness tests
% - How can we test a system that we create?
% - What test data is available? ROSE-Youtu Face liveness detection dataset
% - Deep Learning based face liveness detection in videos
% - Cameras used: mobile cameras (most methods use average resolution images from webcams or camera phone)
% - "Deep learning based face liveness detection in videos" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090202/
% - Ideas: texture based - an image of a face will have the facial textures, while the texture of a piece of paper is very different.
% - Video vs Photo. Wtih a video, you don't just use the subject image, but also factor in movement and changes.
    
    \paragraph{Title}
        Facial Liveness Testing for the Web - an analysis of different methods
    \paragraph{Project Type}
        Computer Vision, Image Processing and Security
    \paragraph{Description}
    In order to avoid spoofing in facial recognition systems, liveness tests are needed. While various liveness tests exist,
    some require specialised hardware and are therefore not suitable. This project aims to select the most suitable methods for
    a web facial authentication system, and analyse their effectiveness in terms of security. A liveness test is suitable if it
    uses only one built-in camera (found within laptops in the webcam, or in mobile devices as the front camera), and potentially
    the device screen (which varies in size depending on the device used), and can be done in near real time.
    \paragraph{Preliminary Preparation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Existing liveness tests
            \item What are the datasets available for testing/training of these liveness methods?
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Minimum Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Build the test framework, to test using several different datasets and different methods, comparing them.
            \item Implement the image quality based liveness test.
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Intermediate Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implement the eye tracking liveness method.
            \item Implement the CNN based liveness method (involving texture and temporal metrics).
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Advanced Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implement the facial flashing liveness test.
        \end{itemize}
