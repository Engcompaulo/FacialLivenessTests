One idea is to use Lip Reading methods to get the user to speak certain words:

By detecting the mouth region in the video, this could then be used to determine whether the user is indeed real. With
words generated randomly, this adds randomness to the video.

(still a potential attack to this would be to somehow fetch a video of someone saying all of these words, or some of these words)

(this could be particularly true for celebrities, because video content could be stitched together from their content).
