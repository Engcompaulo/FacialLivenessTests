## ConvNet.

AlexNet was taken and converted to a classification problem using 1 hot encoding (for real and fake respectively).

The initial trial takes in a full colour image, resizes it (within the NN model), and puts it through an Alexnet.

On a very small subset of the data, with 30% being training data, and 70% being validation data, the accuracy yielded was
about 70%, which isn't bad, but can certainly be tested further with more data.

## Next Steps:
- [] More data: try it on the whole dataset
- [] Test properly: allocate a specific test set unrelated to the training process.
- [] Replace image resizing with a face finding/cropping feature. Does this perform better/worse?


We could expect cropping to potentially work better, as currently images could contain faces that are small in size, and therefore some of the background data is interfering with the main outcome.
Cropping would mean the output would be more about the face.
