% Research into:
% - Eigenfaces
% - Sparse Low Rank Bilinear Discriminative Model
% - What are liveness tests
% - How can we test a system that we create?
% - What test data is available? ROSE-Youtu Face liveness detection dataset
% - Deep Learning based face liveness detection in videos
% - Cameras used: mobile cameras (most methods use average resolution images from webcams or camera phone)
% - "Deep learning based face liveness detection in videos" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090202/
% - Ideas: texture based - an image of a face will have the facial textures, while the texture of a piece of paper is very different.
% - Video vs Photo. Wtih a video, you don't just use the subject image, but also factor in movement and changes.
    \paragraph{Title}
        Liveness Tests for Facial Recognition
    \paragraph{Project Type}
        Computer Vision, Image Processing and Security
    \paragraph{Description}
        - determining real faces from photos of faces (i.e. people showing a picture to a camera)

    \paragraph{Preliminary Preparation}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Raw processing using libraw and dcraw
          \item An understanding of ReactJS and Redux
          \item How can I store raw images and edit them appropriately?
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Minimum Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Load DNG RAW files by upload
          \item Exposure adjustment
          \item Noise reduction methods (Gaussian, mean, median)
          \item Web Interface interacting with an image processing server
          \item Non-destructive image adjustment (i.e. no reduction in quality over time)
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Intermediate Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Modern, user friendly User Experience
          \item Spot healing implemented
          \item Haze removal
          \item cropping, rotating and exporting to other formats
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Advanced Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Addressing potential scalability issues
          \item Implement basic previews using built in JPEG to improve QoS
        \end{itemize}
